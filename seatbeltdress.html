            <h4>Music: <span>Smoking Section - St Vincent</span></h4>
            <p>Jaxon is a friend and performer, they were talking to me about an upcoming performance at another close friends party and we collaborated on this costume. They wanted a garment that spoke well to the emotional depth of the song and narrative behind the performance. This is constrained, sad, defeated.</p>

            <h1>SMOKING SECTION ST VINCENT LYRICS</h1>
            <p>Sometimes I sit in the smoking section<br>Hopin' one rogue spark will land in my direction<br>And when you stomp me out, I scream and I'll shout<br>"Let it happen, let it happen, let it happen."<br><br>And sometimes I feel like an inland ocean<br>Too big to be a lake, too small to be an attraction<br>And when you wander in and start to flail a bit<br>I let it happen, let it happen, let it happen<br><br>Sometimes I stand with a pistol in hand<br>I fire at the grass just to scare you right back<br>And when you won't run, I'm mad but I succumb<br>Let it happen, let it happen, let it happen<br><br>And sometimes I go to the edge of my roof<br>And I think I'll jump just to punish you<br>And if I should float on the taxis below<br>No one would notice, no one will know<br><br>And then I think<br>What could be better than love, than love, than love?<br>And then I think<br>What could be better than love, than love, than love?<br><br>It's not the end, it's not the end<br>It's not the end, it's not the end<br>It's not the end, it's not the end<br>It's not the end, it's not the end<br>It's not the end, it's not the end<br>It's not the end, it's not the end</p>
