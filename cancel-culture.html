            <h1>Cancel culture and John Galliano's Newspaper dress, Dior 2000</h1>
            <img src="media/print.png">
            <p>‘Cancel culture’ is the use of social capital to censor another person due to their opinions or actions, which are deemed politically incorrect. People who participate in ‘cancel culture’ may feel they are helping society however they can have the opposite effect. Jeannie Beard (2020) suggests this act relinquishes democracy by creating a mandatory consensus or in Domina Petric’s (2020) opinion a form of totalitarianism, coined by Dreher (2020) as ‘soft totalitarianism’. Through this contemporary lens I will investigate whether it is possible to separate art from the artist. I will be analysing the infamous Galliano Gazette Dress (fig. 1) from Christian Dior Fall 2000 ready-to-wear collection and its context in popular media. <br><br>
            The Galliano Gazette Dress was part of the ready-to-wear collection inspired by the Haute Couture of Spring 2000 titled ‘Les Clochards’ (fig. 2) and based around the homeless population of Paris. Galliano was scathed by critics for the collection. The harsh critique of these collections (Lupica, 2017) centred around a complete disregard for the homeless people that inspired the collections which sold for thousands of dollars. Dior profited off this community and made no commitment to help them in return. The dress is a classic bias-cut design, with a very low draped back, Galliano gazette newspaper print, a cowl neck and asymmetric skirt. <br><br>
            On screen, the theme of lust and sex evoked by the bias-cut dress was extended by the character Carrie Bradshaw, played by Sarah Jessica Parker in Sex and the City (fig. 3). The impact this dress had on audiences gave the garment and its newspaper print a life of its own, elevating the garment as one of Dior’s more famous contemporary designs. Years later, Sex and the City returned, this time to the silver screen where the dress featured again as an homage to its cult fame. Each of these features in media changed the context of the dress, moving it from the runway into the pop culture. This re-contextualisation is what has separated the art from the artist.<br><br>
            The 2000 Fall collection wasn’t the only time John Galliano has been put under scrutiny; in 2011 he was arrested and fired from Dior due to several anti-semitic and racist rants at a popular Parisian brassier. That dress now symbolises a nostalgia of 2000s fashion when couture houses were at their peak and producing some of the best work the fashion world has ever seen before the global financial crisis despite Galliano’s racist actions. The entire fall 2000 collection being of epic significance in this nostalgia. Another huge cult following of people, many of whom are young, adoring the designs from this collection, most of these followers would be aware of the insensitive inspirations and arguably controversial designer John Galliano again separating the art from the artist. I think it can be argued that in the case of Galliano, the art is indeed separated from the artist if you view the garment and Galliano as a collective. <br><br>
            Using cancel culture as a lens to analyse this dress and further this collection in a contemporary time, it would not be received in the same way, certainly not be glorified as it is in the current subculture of fashion nostalgia. However I believe that when looking at fashion as an art form and not necessity, you must not separate art from artist. Instead the artist should be given the space to learn, grow  and change behaviours, as many people were given the chance to in the past, for example John Galliano who is still a prominent fashion designer. This is not always the case in the current cancel culture world, hence I argue that, through this garment analysis and a focus on the re-contextualisation of the Galliano Gazette dress and John Galliano through pop culture, that the same chance to change is not granted to artists now hence making cancel culture majorly disruptive to fashion design.<br><br>
