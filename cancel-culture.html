            <h1>Cancel Culture and John Galliano's Newspaper dress, Dior 2000</h1>
            <img src="media/print.png">
            <p>&lsquo;Cancel culture' is the use of ones social capital to censor another person due to their opinions or actions, which are deemed politically incorrect. People who participate in &lsquo;'cancel culture'&rsquo; may feel they are helping society however they can have the opposite effect. Jeannie Beard (2020) suggests this act relinquishes democracy by creating a mandatory consensus or in Domina Petric&rsquo;s (2020) opinion a form of totalitarianism, coined by Dreher (2020) as &lsquo;soft totalitarianism&rsquo;. However, 'cancel culture' at its origin was to give voice to the minority, to the otherwise silent which, in some instances of noise or action against their ostracisation would be put at great physical and/or social risk. Through this contemporary lens I will investigate whether it is possible to separate art from the artist and morality revolving around the concept of 'cancel culture'. I will analyse the infamous Galliano Gazette Dress from Christian Dior Fall 2000 ready-to-wear collection (Fig. 1), its context in popular media, social norms of transgression and forgiveness and how this affects emerging creative people across a whole spectrum of the arts but in particular in fashion. Additionally and in examples such as emerging designers I will discuss the power of 'cancel culture' and its origins of good intensions. <br><br> <img src="media/cancelculture/fig%202.jpg">The Galliano Gazette Dress was part of the ready-to-wear collection inspired by the Haute Couture of Spring 2000 titled &lsquo;Les Clochards&rsquo; (Fig. 2) and based around the homeless population of Paris. Galliano was scathed by critics for the collection. The harsh critique of these collections (Lupica, 2017) centred around a complete disregard for the homeless people that inspired the collections which sold for thousands of dollars. Dior profited off this community and made no commitment to help them in return. The dress is a classic bias-cut design, with a very low back, Galliano gazette newspaper print, a cowl neck and asymmetric skirt. <br><br> On screen, the theme of lust and sex evoked by the bias-cut dress was extended by the character Carrie Bradshaw, played by Sarah Jessica Parker in &lsquo;Sex and the City&rsquo; (Fig. 3). The impact this dress had on audiences gave the garment and its newspaper print a life of its own, elevating the garment as one of Dior&rsquo;s more famous contemporary designs. Years later, &lsquo;Sex and the City&rsquo; returned, this time to the silver screen where the dress featured again as an homage to its cult fame. Each of these features in media changed the context of the dress, moving it from the runway into the pop culture. This re-contextualisation is what has separated the art from the artist. <br><br><img src="media/cancelculture/fig%203.jpg"> The 2000 Fall collection wasn&rsquo;t the only time John Galliano has been put under scrutiny; in 2011 he was arrested and fired from Dior due to several anti-semitic and racist rants at a popular Parisian brassier. That dress now symbolises a nostalgia of 2000s fashion when couture houses were at their peak and producing some of the best work the fashion world has ever seen before the global financial crisis despite Galliano&rsquo;s racist actions. The entire fall 2000 collection being of epic significance in this nostalgia. Another huge cult following of people, many of whom are young, adoring the designs from this collection, most of these followers would be aware of the insensitive inspirations and arguably controversial designer John Galliano again separating the art from the artist. I think it can be argued that in the case of Galliano, the art is indeed separated from the artist if you view the garment and Galliano as a collective. <br><br> Furthermore, Galliano committed to a rehabilitation plan of over 4 years where he made several modest public appearances including an apology with Rabbi Barry Marcus of the Central synagogue in London(Fig. 4). He spoke at a Jewish educational project event where he is quoted saying &ldquo;I am an alcoholic. I am an addict,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is in no way an excuse. We alcoholics and we addicts are not responsible for our disease. However, I do take complete responsibility for my recovery and making amends.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;I get a daily reprieve from this disease and that comes from total abstinence.&rdquo; (Watt, 2015, para. 3) This apology came a few months after the appointment of Galliano as creative director of legendary Maison Martin Margiela. Rabbi Barry Marcus is reported to have sat front row at Galliano&rsquo;s first show for the house and has played a major role in his rehabilitation and assimilation back into the fashion world as a respected designer. Coincidentally Maison Margiela left a legacy and a mystery that paired well with Galliano&rsquo;s need for reparation to society. Martin Margiela has been called the &lsquo;ghost designer&rsquo; as he never gave interviews or appeared after his shows. There is only one documented photo of him which is not verified, even the label on Margiela garments is nondescript. This anonymous nature of the house suited the role Galliano needed to play to ensure his forgiveness, it was a very convenient return to the fashion world in this way. He has only recently been vocal about his work again almost 10 years after his recorded racist rants. However, social justice crusaders who police the internet in the name of 'cancel culture' would not allow this sort of growth in people as the world has given Galliano. There are of course people who are still hurt by his actions and choose to boycott his work whether that be on a purchasing/ commercial level or simply engaging with the imagery that comes from his collections at Margiela. The point is that he is widely accepted and respected as a fashion designer again. <br><br> Using 'cancel culture' as a lens to analyse this dress and further this collection in a contemporary time, it would not be received in the same way, certainly not be glorified as it is in the current subculture of fashion nostalgia. However I believe that when looking at fashion as an art form and not necessity, you must not separate art from artist. Instead the artist should be given the space to learn, grow and change behaviours, as many people were given the chance to in the past. This is not always the case in the current 'cancel culture' world, hence I argue that, through this garment analysis and with a focus on re-contextualising the Galliano Gazette dress and John Galliano through pop culture, that the same chance for progression is not granted to artists now. Particularly where an emerging designer is concerned, I do not believe people would be given this same chance, even when you consider the scale down of Galliano's situation to a emerging designer level. How many people have the perseverance and resilience to make it out the other side as he did? 'Cancel culture' is majorly disruptive to fashion design on all levels, however it would be paradoxical to simply &lsquo;cancel&rsquo; &lsquo;'cancel culture'&rsquo;. <br><br> There is no doubt that 'cancel culture' has evolved into a disruptive unorganised agent that ultimately hurts many, however the intensions of 'cancel culture' or call out culture must not become forgotten. The well intentioned beginnings of &lsquo;calling out&rsquo; and its successor 'cancel culture' are admirable in the case of giving voice to minorities and their plight. This is most prominent in cases between transgender communities and the cis heteronormative world. Transgender people are among the most vulnerable people in our society. A 2015 U.S. transgender survey by the &lsquo;National Centre for Transgender Equality&rsquo; showed that &ldquo;46% of respondents were verbally harassed in the past year because of being transgender. 9% of respondents were physically attacked in the past year because of being transgender. 47% of respondents were sexually assaulted at some point in their lifetime and one in ten (10%) were sexually assaulted in the past year. In communities of colour, these numbers are higher: 53% of Black respondents were sexually assaulted in their lifetime and 13% were sexually assaulted in the last year. 54% experienced some form of intimate partner violence, including acts involving coercive control and physical harm&rdquo; (National Centre for Transgender Equality, 2016). This survey highlights why the trans community needs the safety of online 'cancel culture' because there are such high rates of violence that to actively correct someones wrongdoings to that individual or their community would put that person at greater risk to this violence. This is an example of 'cancel culture' doing good, however it so often gets discounted as it operates outside of the norms of civility (Aly &amp; Stephens, 2019) and the inherent &lsquo;in-fighting&rsquo; that manifests from individualism in communities that rely on collectivism for social change. In the Podcast The Minefield: Does &ldquo;calling-out&rdquo; do more harm than good&rdquo; Waleed Aly and Scott Stephens (2019) discuss ideas around the unorganised nature of 'cancel culture' and hence its failure to be constructive to society. They speak about the intention of the person cancelling as a moral compass of whether or not the cancelling is deserved or valid. The conclusion is that 'cancel culture' is unproductive but the medium of 'cancel culture' could be useful (McLuhan, 1967). This paradox within the concept of 'cancel culture' is too subjective to be of any benefit to either, the canceller or the cancelled, explaining a need for a more organised approach. I look to the union movement to provide example of how an organised minority has immense power against the powerful, in the workers case that power being their employer. <br><br> The success of the mobilisation of workers in the union movement is a testament to the power of collectivism for the minority. Unions have played a pivotal role in workers equality in Australia and across the world. The union acts as an agent on behalf of workers to negotiate with employers, there has to be a majority of a work force for the union to have any real impact on individual employers or companies however they also campaign for general rights within the workforce. Through advocacy, campaigns, protests and strikes unions have been able to get in the position they are now, which is sometimes one of great power (Clark, 2018). When considering the comparison between workers and the trans community its clear that the main and possibly only similarity is that they are in a less powerful position than their counterparts. When considering unions and 'cancel culture' as a medium the similarity is the fact both are an agent for respective minorities and both are criticised and sometimes misunderstood (McLuhan, 1967). Another similarity is the union tradition of striking; in the contemporary 'cancel culture' you see people boycott the cancelled individual, location or event due to the social capital of the canceller. For example, on twitter recently, a performer who is a trans woman of colour named Juku tweeted &ldquo;Stop buying shit by pissy pussy before I post that video of him blacked out at the Rosemont calling a crowd of trans people and trans performers transphobic&rdquo;(Fig.5). This is an example of 'cancel culture' and persuasion to boycott a certain individual for their actions and/or opinions. This post essentially cancels Pissy Pussy due to this drunken rant, who has a cult following within the queer community and identifies as a cis white gay man. A comment on this tweet backs in with another case of Pissy Pussy being deemed inappropriate saying &ldquo;lichuraly [literally] one of the worst people I&rsquo;ve worked with, nothing but rude to me &amp; tried to get one of our black coworkers fired for not knowing a trans persons pronouns at work&rdquo; (Fig.6 ). Another comment saying &ldquo;Thanks for letting me know this. definitely unfollowing. I liked their work a lot but wow. How messy.&rdquo; (Fig. 6). I chose this as an example as it indicates the less powerful using the medium of 'cancel culture' to bring out truth in a protected way against someone more powerful and the immediate boycotting of the cancelled by others in the community. The same way a unionised worker has the right to withdraw their labor to demand reform in the medium of a strike. Due to these similarities I suggest that the success of the union movement could be a source of inspiration for 'cancel culture' as a medium in the future to be a constructive and valued mode of cultural progression. However, 'cancel culture' cannot rest solely on its potential, it must be mobilised and it must be organised. <br><br> After analysing both the harm of 'cancel culture' using Galliano as an example of what young designers now will not experience due to 'cancel culture' and the benefit of 'cancel culture' in protecting those in less powerful positions, I conclude that 'cancel culture' is inadequate at executing its true intentions nor is it constructive, however, it could be. It is too easy to rule 'cancel culture' out as the people who need it are often outside the accepted norm in all its contemporary terms whether that be gender, race, sexuality, age, political views or socioeconomic background. We are conditioned to see things that are outside this norm to be a threat hence peoples dismissal of 'cancel culture' and its reputation of being uncivil, trivial and of virtual and millennial creation, hence its lack purpose or value in society as a whole. Through the comparison of the union movement I hoped to leave suggestion on how 'cancel culture' might be able to work with obvious limitations as the issues raised by 'cancel culture' are more complex and diverse than workers rights, however there should not be an absence of hope when tackling new ideas and I think that is exactly what 'cancel culture' is, an idea yet to reach fruition. This project and analysis grew out of my fear of creating in this climate of 'cancel culture'. I am not scared of 'cancel culture' anymore this analysis has enabled me to better understand the role of an artist or designer in the progression of ideas and within fashion a discourse about improvement and community. <br><br> Replica Project Statement <br><br> When considering the replication of the &lsquo;Galliano Gazette&rsquo; dress, its context and my analysis and critique of 'cancel culture' I looked at the origins of the word replica, and came across the Italian word &lsquo;replicare' which translates to &lsquo;to reply&rsquo;. I really liked this version of the word as it fit with how I was approaching my concept and framed a reply to my analysis of the garment and of 'cancel culture'. I&rsquo;ve taken this idea of the newspaper print and distorted and warped it as thats what 'cancel culture' does with information to ensure its power, very comparable to that of totalitarian reign (Beard, 2020) and Trump with his refusal to accept fact. I was inspired by warped typography as I really like the aesthetic and didn&rsquo;t want to make it too much of a literal replica of a newspaper and thought this idea of distortion and artifice fit well with my critique of 'cancel culture'. I then thought about how I could incorporate colour, there is a quote by Australian artist Brett Whiteley that I have for a long time loved where he says &ldquo;Blue, ultramarine blue, hits my nervous system in such an exciting way&mdash;there is no other colour. It has an obsessive, ecstasy-like effect upon my nervous system quite unlike any colour, it&rsquo;s not a word thing.&rdquo;(Whiteley, 1987). I resonate with this because it talks to how a colour can effect you and provoke reaction. I think this notion of provoking reaction is important in fashion and relative to my concept of 'cancel culture' and having &lsquo;replicare&rsquo; (to reply) as a premise I chose to incorporate that colour to shock, to provoke the audience both intellectually and visually. For my design I have looked at the bias cut which Galliano is very famous for, and have gone for a similar design with a low draped back all cut on the bias, I think I have renewed the design to be more contemporary or maybe more classicised; the original design adheres to 2000s fashion aesthetic with the asymmetric skirt and the metal hardware on the straps. (Fig. 7). The replication of the physical design hence becomes secondary and a focus on the replica, the reply to and the critique of the context surrounding the &lsquo;Galliano Gazette&rsquo; dress. This context being the original inspirations of the &lsquo;le clochards&rsquo; couture show, Galliano&rsquo;s history of antisemitism and his return to the fashion world, the glorification and idolisation of the dress through pop- culture and the subculture of fashion nostalgia. When it came to visual representation of the garment I decided to do a photoshoot which was photographed by Rowan Kuskopf and modelled by Jed Milgate. <br><br> I styled the dress with a pair of Maison Margiela tabi boots as a humours nod to Galliano&rsquo;s current position at the house. I chose to present two styles of image, one to show the dress for presentation purposes and the other a moody editorial featuring spotlight lighting emulating putting a spotlight and investigating 'cancel culture' as I have done throughout this project (Fig. 8). I wanted to present this piece writing to accompany my design portfolio work as I felt I went on a process and sort of journey with 'cancel culture' through this project from being cautious and anxious about creating in a world where 'cancel culture' exists and can really harm ones career, to now understanding its place and validity in our contemporary world and the power of the artist and designer to move with the discourse of their practice and broader society to improve it. <br><br> Beard, J 2020, &lsquo;Click Bait, Cancel Culture &amp; the Rhetoris of Civil Discourse&rsquo;, Dr Jeanie Beard PhD, viewed 3 April 2020, &lt;http://dr.jeanniebeard.com/2020/02/click-bait-cancel-culture-the-rhetoric-of- civic-discourse/&gt; <br><br> Petric, D 2020, &lsquo;Soft and Inverted Totalitarianism&rsquo;, Research Gate, viewed 3 April 2020, &lt;https:// www.researchgate.net/profile/Domina_Petric/publication/ 339843432_Soft_and_Inverted_Totalitarianism/links/5e68ba6f299bf1744f72e143/Soft-and- Inverted-Totalitarianism.pdf&gt; <br><br> Dreher, R 2019, &lsquo;Yes, Its Totalitarianism&rsquo;, The American Conservative, viewed 3 April 2020, &lt;https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/yes-its-totalitarianism-intersectional-left-ibram- x-kendi-andrei-serban/&gt; <br><br> Lupica, L H 2017, &lsquo;The interesting history behind Carrie's infamous newspaper dress&rsquo; Vogue, viewed 3 April 2020, &lt;https://www.vogue.com.au/fashion/news/the-interesting-history-behind- carries-infamous-newspaper-dress/news-story/8f75400e3157c3c17a696e7ac3e841d8&gt; <br><br> Watt, H 2015, &lsquo;John Galliano speaks at Jewish event: 'I am an alcoholic.
