            <p>Through investigating denim I became fascinated by the journey of denim from being a uniform for the working class and being some of the most iconic garments in subcultures and pop culture. In particular I enjoyed denim in the punk aesthetic as it tied back to the working class through the act of protest. Both the punks and the working class wore denim and both used protest in various forms to combat against the more powerful. The role of denim in these acts of protest may have just been the fact that it was worn during, but I think that carries some sort of narrative in it especially when the act is something so visceral and emotionally charged. I explored protest as a broader theme and landed on queer protest as thats something I hold close to me. I am grateful for and respect the trans women of colour who protested in June of 1969 at the stonewall riots who are the reason I as queer person have the rights I do today. It has become a big part of queer protesting to throw paint, usually red to symbolise the blood of HIV positive people. This act of throwing paint is a very punk way of behaving which is why I decided to incorporate this into my design. Through the duration of the photoshoot paint was thrown at the model to symbolise this. The frayed edges a hem are a nod to the punk aesthetic, while the choice of model is a nod to queerness, they are queer and as a masc presenting person wearing a skirt is still sometimes considered wrong or inappropriate.</p>
