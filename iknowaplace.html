            <p>The preliminary research for this small collection begun with investigation into the shirt and its history. I became fascinated with the reclaiming nature of women throughout the past and how they often used fashion to symbolise this reclamation. Seen through the female suit and personas such as Marlena Dietrich toying with masculine and feminine ideas in one identity onward from the 20s and design such as Le Smoking Suit by Yves Saint Laurent. Later, feminists in the 60s started the burn your bra movement where women wore sheer blouses with nothing underneath to metaphorically unchain themselves from the patriarchy, symbolised by the bra and its constriction. This strong sense of reclaiming led me to delve into what my community, the LGBTQIA+ community has reclaimed, how that is related to fashion and what fashion means to the queer identity.<br><br>I researched into the history of queer dress and how that relates to reclamation and queer people now. From my research I realised that a lot of queer fashion has come from trying to blend into heteronormative society and now more than ever that isn’t the case. From this I decided to attempt to answer some design questions about:<br><br>What queer fashion and queer identity is now and what that might look like in the future? <br><br>However, as I am only one a part of a whole community I decided to interview LGBTQIA+ people and have a face to face conversation with Pancetta Love (Sam). Sam is an artist, designer and drag performer. They have worked as a fashion designer with their own label, combining their fine art practice with textiles to produce their work; they now design and make a lot of their own costumes for performances. A lot of the answers from the community told about a feeling, a moment and a power that fashion can give to ones queer identity. Sam also talked about this sense of power and now my proposed design questions seemed some what irrelevant. <br><br>The relationship between queer fashion or just fashion in general and queer identity is not definable by a style or a particular opinion of what it looks like. It’s about that feeling and that power one gets when you’re expressing yourself freely through dress, that is what I have used to inform my design work for this project.<br><br>The collection has been named after a song by queer band Muna, the song ‘I know a place’ talks about friends helping each other through a hard time and knowing a place they can be safe in order to survive and stay strong. It says “you think being yourself means being unworthy, and it’s hard to love with a heart that hurting, but if you want to go out dancing, I know place that we can go, where everyone gonna lay down their weapon.” “I know a place where you don’t need protection, even if it’s in my imagination”. This song brings a lot of fond memories for me, it played the night that the same sex marriage bill passed, I was out with my closest friends at a queer venue that helped me learn a lot about my identity and be who I needed to be. The song evokes the same feeling for me that I let inform my design process for this assessment so it seemed only natural to make the work an ode to that feeling, this song, and queerness in general.</p>
